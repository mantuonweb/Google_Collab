        "*   Several challenges were overcome during the setup, including `ImportError` due to package version conflicts, `ValidationError` from `OPENAI_API_KEY` not being persistently loaded, `NameError` because tools were not defined in scope, and `ValueError` due to a missing prompt template variables (`tools`, `tool_names`).\n",
        "*   Four custom tools—`ingest_resumes_tool`, `list_resumes_tool`, `search_resumes_tool`, and `clear_resumes_tool`—were defined using the `@tool` decorator and successfully integrated into the agent's environment.\n",
        "*   A ReAct agent and an `AgentExecutor` were successfully initialized using `gpt-4o-mini` as the Large Language Model and the defined set of tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The agent is now fully configured and ready to be interacted with. The next crucial step is to test its functionality thoroughly using diverse example queries to ensure it utilizes the tools correctly and responds as expected.\n"
